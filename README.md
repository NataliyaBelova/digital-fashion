# Creative Computing in Fashion Industry 

Digital fashion is the visual representation of clothing built using computer technology and 3D software. 
During the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 fashion industry has suffered from strong economic losses, however, 
it learned how to recover digitally through virtual clothing, catwalks, and showrooms. 
The use of 3D modeling or other ways of digital representation became an essential aspect of fashion campaigns.

Augmented Reality (AR) is now highly used in fashion marketing. For example, AR is seen as an innovative sales tool 
that allows consumers to try on clothes digitally before they buy them. The virtual dressing rooms were introduced 
by online and physical stores. The customers can download the store's app such as GAP’s Virtual Dressing or 
ASOS’s See My Fit App where everyone can customize the body shape of the avatar and see how different sizes would look on them. 
Or Dior gives a chance to potential buyers to try on their sunglasses line through Instagram filters. With such innovation, 
customers can shop safely online, predict the fit of the wanted garment and easily figure out their true size.

AR is also used in fashion shows. Several design companies explore how to merge IRL and URL experience during the runway.
One of the first companies who started this trend was FINCH that stated on their website *they brought IT values to their brand*, 
by connecting their experience in the IT field with a passion for design and creation. In February 2020, they presented 
a new collection using AR and 3D printing. The "runway" was transformed into an exhibition place with small 3D printed sculptures of the garments,
meanwhile, the viewers could use their phones to see the garment on a bigger scale through AR. Therefore, by breaking the boundaries 
of the traditional fashion industry viewers could get an alternative perspective of looking at the high fashion items. 

Institute of Digital Fashion (IoDF) works in a similar direction as FINCH. For London Fashion Week in September 2021, 
IoDF created an augmented reality to spotlight the latest Richard Quinn’s collaboration with Royal Salute. The whole runway was turned into 
an Instagrammable digital playground. This project aimed to break the old paradigm and make the fashion landscape more accessible to the mass. 
AR and technologies can deliver a new way of engaging with fashion, learning about it, consuming it more innovatively and sustainably. 

Thus, computer technologies play important role in the newly developing field inside of the fashion industry. By digitalizing garments,
the fashion industry can function more sustainably. While AR technologies can ease online shopping, present new collections in a more engaging way,
and make fashion more accessible to the mass. However, should high fashion become accessible?

After making a reserch abour AR and 3D modeling in fashion. I decided to come with a simple 3D dress in Blender, using open-source file I found the female body that I used as a model.

My next steps were to animate a catwalk and then adjust the dress to the moving body.
